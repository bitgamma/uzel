Uzel
====

Uzel is your home's control panel. Technically it is a node based application server and hub for [OSNP](https://github.com/briksoftware/osnp) networks. It can handle any OSNP-compatible device and host any number of virtual appliances written for it. It ships with a device manager and a Dashboard appliance, which allows you to monitor all connected devices.

Devices can be anything, including temperature sensors, HVAC, water pumps, humidity sensors, switches, lights, etc.
Appliances are express.js based web applications, hosted on Uzel, performing tasks like controlling the air conditioning, monitoring and irrigating plants, opening or locking doors etc.

Uzel takes care of discovering, pairing/unpairing devices and making them available to appliances. It provides an easy web interface to administrate it.

The project is still at a quite early development stage, more documentation will follow as the project status advances.
